Hannah by Shel Silverstein

Hannah loves me,
Hannah cares,
Hannah picks me peaches and pears.
Hannah offers me candy and Cokes,
Hannah listens and laughs at me jokes.
Hannah helps when I get in a fight,
Hannah does all my homework at night.
Hannah misses me,
Hannah cries,
Hannah thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Hannah is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Hannah just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Hannah's hand,
In the darkness where Hannah usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Hannah's gone!
